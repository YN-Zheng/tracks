# *Dialogues with Li Bai*
*—Atop a sea of clouds, a drunken man leans against a pine. From the mist emerges a frowning youth.*

---

### **Kai** (parting the fog):
> "Banished immortal, your verses always say *'Heaven and earth are but inns for all creatures.'* Yet if we’re mere guests passing through this fleeting century—what’s the meaning?"  
> (Dust from modern cities stains his sleeves; shredded to-do lists crumple in his palm)

---

### **Li Bai** (tossing a wine jar into the abyss, echoes tolling like bells):
> "Meaning? Ha! Watch the falling jar—  
> Before shattering, it cradles mountain winds, birdsong, freedom.  
> When it breaks, its clay will birth wildflowers.  
> Which moment is more *alive*?"  
> (Suddenly eyeing the torn paper in the youth’s hand, he laughs)  
> "Young friend, clutching time like clutching sand—  
> Better learn to toss silver jars for wine.  
> Shatter the glass, let moonlight get drunk."

---

### **Kai** (releasing the scraps into the wind):
> "But without eternal value, all creation fades. Even your poems—one day, none may read them…"  
> (Startled, the flying scraps transform into egrets perched on Li Bai’s shoulders)

---

### **Li Bai** (dipping sword-tip in wine, writing verses in air):
> "Eternity’s a prison! My poems lived when sung in Chang’an taverns,  
> Now they breathe on your digital screens.  
> Behold—"  
> (Sword-qi churns clouds, revealing neon and stars entwined)  
> "Meaning’s a drunkard’s belch—  
> Swallow all sorrows and joys,  
> Then it burns upward from your throat."

---

### **Kai** (touching glowing mist, verses emerging in palm-lines):
> "Yet doubt clings like a shadow…"  
> (A whale-shaped cloud rises from the abyss beneath his feet)

---

### **Li Bai** (pulling him onto the cloud-whale):
> "Deeper shadows mean fiercer light! Watch—"  
> (The whale pierces stormclouds; sudden bloody dawn erupts)  
> "A millennium past I wrote *‘Bright moon rises over Tianshan’*—  
> Now your eyes see reshaped mountains,  
> But this newborn dawn—does it know the ancient moon?"  
> (Plucking a shard of dawn, he casts it into the youth’s chest)  
> "Drink this instant—it outshines a thousand years of searching."

---

### **Kai** (flame-blooms erupting from his ribs):
> "So meaning is…"  
> (Unfinished, the cloud-whale plummets into Milky Way; laughter clinks with stardust)

## **Epilogue**
*When Kai wakes in a 3 AM convenience store,*  
*A water-stained verse stains his palm:*

**"Meaning is wings forged from questions—**  
**Answers shed gold dust with each beat.**  
**Your chase after fleeting glints**  
**Becomes the cosmos’ most thrilling palindrome."**
